Network-Based Game-Theoretic Modeling of Financial Infrastructure
Design a network-based, game-theoretic model to analyze strategic
interactions among financial institutions such as banks, exchanges, and
clearing houses operating within a shared financial infrastructure.
The model should capture how local decisions such as credit provision,
margin requirements, and trade routing interact through network
connections like credit exposures and settlement obligations. These
interactions should explain how individual incentives influence systemlevel outcomes including liquidity flow, congestion, systemic risk, and
financial stability.
The system must account for strategic behavior under incomplete
information and demonstrate how localized decisions propagate through
the network to either strengthen resilience or trigger cascading failures.
Business Impact:
This model helps regulators and financial institutions understand how
micro-level decisions can create macro-level financial risks. By
identifying fragile structures, bottlenecks, and incentive misalignments,
the solution supports better regulatory policies, safer clearing
mechanisms, improved risk management, and more resilient financial
systems capable of withstanding economic shocks.
